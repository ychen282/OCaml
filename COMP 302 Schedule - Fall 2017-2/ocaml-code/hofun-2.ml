   function (fun x -> fun y -> f (x,y) which is equivalent to 
   (fun x y -> f (x,y)).

   Remember: fun describes an anonymous function which can take in
     multiple arguments, but does not allow pattern matching on the
     arguments.

   are values and taking in 3 values. *)

let cur = fun f -> fun x -> fun y -> f (x,y)


(* What happens if we try and execute the following:

# let plus (x,y) = x + y;;
val plus : int * int -> int = <fun>
# cur plus ;;
- : int -> int -> int = <fun>
# curry plus ;;
- : int -> int -> int = <fun>
# 

Why can we not *see* the return function?
Meaning why doesn't it show the actual function?

well, functions are values and they evaluate to themselves.
ML-like language like OCaml do not print back to you the "code" for
the function plus, it will not print back to you the code
for the function we get by  (curry plus)

To understand what is happening, we really need to
have an understanding of the operational semantics...

val uncurry : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a * 'b -> 'c = <fun>

Can one prove:

For any function f, uncurry (curry f) = f? 

- Debugger not very helpful.

#trace curry;;
curry is now traced.
# #trace uncurry;;
uncurry is now traced.
# uncurry (curry plus);;
curry <-- <fun>
curry --> <fun>
uncurry <-- <fun>
uncurry --> <fun>
- : int * int -> int = <fun>

 - Not so easy...because what we get is not directly f
   (technically...)
